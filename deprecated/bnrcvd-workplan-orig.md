## Introduction  

This page is our **living project tracker** for the BNR–CVD Refit. It provides a week-by-week breakdown of planned activities, a brief descriptions for each task, expected deliverables, and a simple note of whether the task is Not Started (❌), Underway (🟨), or Completed (✅).  

The aim of this refit is to create a **sustainable, reproducible and open analytical framework** for the Barbados National Registry (CVD component).  

By the end of February 2026, the project will:  

1. Deliver a semi-automated **Stata package (`bnrcvd.pkg`)** to generate reports from exported registry data.  
2. Produce a final **2023 Annual Report (PDF)** using the new automation pipeline.  
3. Produce suggested **Monthly** and **Administrative** reports as needed.
4. Establish clear **Data Sharing and Trust Agreements (DSTA)** for long-term data governance.  
5. Publish a **self-paced learning and documentation website**, currently hosted at [ianhambleton.github.io/bnr-refit](https://ianhambleton.github.io/bnr-refit).

!!! warning

    The Refit project assumptions included the following caveat for successful operation:

    > The BNR must produce and share clean cardiovascular datasets for all years of operation.

    The BNR project was unable to produce a cumulative dataset of CVD cases. The Refit project therefore extended it's remit to include a pre-processing phase (Phase 0 below). **This phase aimed to produce a definitive cumulative record of CVD cases, from BNR initiation to end-2023.**

## Phase 0 – Pre-Project Dataset Preparation  
**Dates:** June - October 2025

| 🟨 | Generate flagged data issues report | Produce descriptive report using flag variables to summarise all identified data anomalies. | Internal issue log and DQ recommendations report. |
| 🟨 | Maintain queries log | Continue recording data issues and potential new DQ rules in “Queries Log for Christina.” | Updated ongoing data-quality tracking file. |
| ✅ | Locate raw data sources | Attempt to retrieve original raw case-finding and abstraction datasets (2009–2021) from shared drives and archives. | Confirmed archival status: only partial backups available. |
