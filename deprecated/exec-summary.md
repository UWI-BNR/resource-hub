# Executive Summary  
### Barbados National Registry (BNR) – Process Audit  
*Prepared for the BNR Advisory Committee and Ministry of Health and Wellness, 2025*

---

## Purpose of the Audit
This review was undertaken to strengthen the efficiency, accuracy, and long-term sustainability of the Barbados National Registry’s Cardiovascular Disease (BNR–CVD) system.  
It builds on strong national progress since the registry’s establishment and responds to new opportunities to modernise data capture, quality control, and reporting as Barbados moves further into the digital era.

## Key Findings at a Glance
| **Process Area** | **Current Challenges** | **Improvement Opportunity** |
|------------------|------------------------|-----------------------------|
| **Case Capture & Preparation (Pre-REDCap)** | Mortality data depend on national death registration that currently does not assign underlying cause of death (UCOD). Case-finding has over time applied inconsistent eligibility definitions. | Strengthen reliability by re-anchoring the registry in hospitals and introducing national UCOD coding. |
| **Data Entry & Quality Control (Within-REDCap)** | The 2023 database rebuild left some validation and documentation gaps. | Lock and stabilise the REDCap platform, reinstate data checks, and build a living data dictionary. |
| **Analysis & Reporting (Post-REDCap)** | No single “official” cumulative dataset and reliance on older Stata scripts. | Establish dataset governance, modernise analytics, and deliver faster, policy-relevant reporting. |

Across all stages, the audit found dedicated staff working within a complex system that has evolved over many years.  
The findings reflect an opportunity—not a setback—to re-engineer the registry into a model of digital public-health reporting.

## Five Immediate Priorities (0–6 months)
| **#** | **Action** | **Transformational Benefit** |
|:--:|----------------|------------------------------|
| 1️⃣ | Finalise and approve a single cumulative dataset (to Dec 2023). | Creates an authoritative national CVD record. |
| 2️⃣ | Lock the production REDCap version and reinstate validation rules. | Protects data integrity and comparability. |
| 3️⃣ | Define and safeguard a 30–40-variable **Core Dataset**. | Guarantees completeness of key national indicators. |
| 4️⃣ | Re-focus on a **hospital-based registry model** for case capture. | Stabilises incidence monitoring and ensures accuracy. |
| 5️⃣ | Implement WHO **IRIS** software for automated UCOD coding. | Delivers a national, automated mortality-coding system for Barbados. |

## Phased Improvement Plan
| **Stage** | **Timeline** | **Strategic Goal** |
|------------|--------------|--------------------|
| **Stage 1** | 0–6 months | Stabilise data foundation and governance. |
| **Stage 2** | 6–12 months | Modernise analytics and documentation using open, interoperable standards. |
| **Stage 3** | 12–24 months | Expand registry coverage and integrate new conditions within a digital-ready platform. |
