# Refit: What’s Changing (at a glance)

The **BNR Refit** is strengthening the way we manage, analyse, and report registry data.  
It builds on existing processes to make them **more consistent, transparent, and automated** — ensuring that every dataset and report can be trusted and reproduced.

## The 5-phase plan

**Phase 0 — Build the foundation**  
Combine all cardiovascular data into a single, clean, auditable dataset.  
Create shared Stata scripts to standardise preparation and analysis.

??? info "More about Phase 0"
    - Merged all cardiovascular data from 2009–2023 into one harmonised dataset.  
    - Checked for variable consistency, duplicates, and completeness.  
    - Defined a single dataset structure for ongoing use.  
    - Developed initial Stata routines for cleaning, sign-off, and reporting.

---

**Phase 1 — Map the system**  
Reviewed all post-abstraction data-handling code and processes to identify inefficiencies and dependencies across the registry workflow.

??? info "More about Phase 1"
    - Audited existing Stata algorithms used for dataset cleaning and reporting.  
    - Documented file interdependencies and workflow order.  
    - Identified upstream process issues affecting data accuracy or reporting speed.  
    - Created a complete overview of how data move from abstraction to analysis.

---

**Phase 2 — Automate the analytics**  
Rebuilt Stata programs into a structured, automated environment.  
This allows reports to be generated directly from approved datasets with minimal manual intervention.

??? info "More about Phase 2"
    - Converted analytics into modular Stata programs linked to the BNR dataset.  
    - Standardised naming conventions, indicators, and output formats.  
    - Automated production of monthly, quarterly, and annual summaries.  
    - Embedded internal checks for data completeness and indicator accuracy.

---

**Phase 3 — Align and integrate**  
Linked the new automated system to the registry’s governance, documentation, and reporting structure.  
This ensures that automation supports quality, accountability, and staff continuity.

??? info "More about Phase 3"
    - Introduced a **dataset sign-off protocol** for monthly and annual releases.  
    - Developed short, accessible SOPs aligned to each of the 14 improvement areas.  
    - Applied a consistent dataset structure across process, analytics, and reporting deliverables.  
    - Updated QC procedures to include version tracking and data verification steps.  
    - Integrated automated analytics with report templates for consistent outputs.

---

**Phase 4 — Share and sustain**  
Documented all processes on this website to maintain transparency, support staff training, and promote continuous improvement.

??? info "More about Phase 4"
    - Published standard operating procedures, flow diagrams, and update logs.  
    - Linked all deliverables to their corresponding recommendations.  
    - Created a reference for onboarding and for technical review by the BNR and GA-CDRC teams.  
    - Ensured that the refit process remains auditable and open to periodic review.

## What this delivers

- **Speed and consistency:** Automated scripts and scheduled reporting.  
- **Transparency:** Signed-off datasets and documented methods.  
- **Quality:** Built-in QC and version control.  
- **Sustainability:** Shared knowledge and reduced reliance on any single staff member.
