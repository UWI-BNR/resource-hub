# Introduction to the BNR Refit Project

The **BNR Refit Project** (2025–2026) is a one-off project designed to revamp and semi-automate the analytics and reporting infrastructure of the cardiovascular component of the Barbados National Registry. Funded by the Barbados Ministry of Health and Wellness, the project is a response to the need for long-term sustainability of the registry, in the face of reduced funding and staffing, and growing data demands.

## Background

Since 2009, the BNR has operated using custom-built processes for collecting, curating, and reporting national cardiovascular disease data. These processes developed using an evolution of data systems over the years and currently (as of October 2025) are dependent on REDCap (for databasing) and Stata (for data analysis). The process has grown complex with heavy reliance on specialised personnel. The current refit aims to:

- Improve efficiency through system automation
- Enable low-code access to key data analytics and reporting
- Standardise data outputs and reporting formats
- Build internal capacity through training and documentation

!!! warning

    The Refit project assumptions included the following caveat for successful completion:

    > The BNR must produce and share clean cardiovascular datasets for all years of operation.

    The BNR project was unable to produce a cumulative dataset of CVD cases. The *Refit Project* therefore extended it's remit to include a pre-processing phase (Phase 0 below). **This phase aimed to produce a single, definitive cumulative record of CVD cases, from BNR initiation to end-2023.**

    Further details are below (**Phase 0**), and in the [**Project Workplan**](bnrcvd-workplan.md).      



## Project Scope

The project was originally organised into FOUR phases, extended to FIVE phases, each with defined deliverables:

| Phase | Activity | Deliverables |
|-------|----------|--------------|
| **0** | **Cumulative dataset preparation**<br>➤ Develop algorithms for joining multiple CVD datasets with differing structures<br>➤ Identify and classify potential dataset errors for review by BNR team | ➤ Cumulative CVD dataset<br>➤ Repository of new Stata scripts<br>➤SOP / web-pages for "going forwards" dataset appending |
| **1** | **Analytics System Assessment**<br>➤ Audit existing Stata algorithms and data resources<br>➤ Develop monthly dataset sign-off process | ➤ Data preparation audit report <br>➤ SOP for dataset release |
| **2** | **Analytics Enhancement**<br>➤ Automate monthly, annual analytics<br>➤ Automate reporting output | ➤ Semi-automated Stata algorithms<br>➤ Report generation scripts |
| **3** | **Overlay Low-Code Access**<br>➤ Build bespoke BNR Stata commands<br>➤ Simple installation | ➤ Bespoke Stata commands<br>➤ SOP for installation and access |
| **4** | **System Training**<br>➤ Conduct staff training<br>➤ Develop online training resources | ➤ 1-day virtual training<br>➤ Online self-paced learning operations manual |

## Key Details

- **Duration**: Jan 2025 – Mar 2026  
- **Software**: Stata (analytics), mkdocs (web development) 
- **Client**: Barbados National Registry (BNR) / The University of the West Indies  
- **Technical Lead**: Dr Christina Howitt

## Guiding Principles

- Preserve analytic rigour  
- Reduce reliance on specialist Stata coding  
- Increase timeliness, transparency, reproducibility of outputs  
- Build a replicable model for potential use across the Caribbean
