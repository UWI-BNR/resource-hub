# Barbados National Registry (BNR) – Draft Data Trust Framework  
_For fair, transparent, and responsible use of BNR data_

---

## 1. Purpose of the BNR Data Trust

The **BNR Data Trust** is a small technical sub-group of the existing **BNR Advisory Committee**. 

Its purpose is to ensure that all data shared from the Barbados National Registry for Chronic Non-Communicable Disease (BNR) are handled safely, fairly, and in line with national law and good research practice.  

The Data Trust:

- Reviews requests for access to restricted or controlled BNR data.  
- Confirms that each request meets ethical, legal, and technical standards.  
- Ensures data use benefits public health and aligns with BNR goals.  
- Reports all decisions and recommendations through the BNR Advisory Committee to the Ministry of Health and Wellness.

This structure keeps oversight **lean, technical, and accountable**, without creating new bureaucracy.

## 2. Guiding Principles

The Data Trust works under the same principles that guide all BNR activities:

1. **Transparency** – All data requests and decisions are recorded and reported through the Advisory Committee.  
2. **Accountability** – Every data release is traceable and approved by named individuals.  
3. **Fairness** – Data are shared on equal terms with all legitimate research partners.  
4. **Proportionality** – Data are only as detailed as necessary for the approved use.  
5. **Public Benefit** – All approved data use must support better health knowledge or policy.

## 3. Composition of the Data Trust

The Data Trust is intentionally small and technical.  
It draws members from within the BNR and its host institution, the George Alleyne Chronic Disease Research Centre (GA-CDRC) with one external academic representative from the University of the West Indies (UWI)

**Members:**

- BNR Technical Lead (Chair)  
- BNR Data Manager or Senior Analyst  
- GA-CDRC Data Governance Representative  
- UWI Faculty Representative (external to GA-CDRC)  

Members serve two-year terms, renewable by agreement. The Trust may invite temporary advisers (e.g. legal or ethics experts) when needed but keeps decision-making to the core group.

## 4. Responsibilities of the Data Trust

The Data Trust is responsible for:

1. **Reviewing and approving** requests for restricted or controlled data.  
2. **Ensuring compliance** with the Barbados Data Protection Act (2019).  
3. **Verifying** that each request has appropriate ethical or institutional approval.  
4. **Advising** on data anonymisation, security, and storage conditions.  
5. **Monitoring** active data sharing agreements for adherence to conditions of use.  
6. **Reporting** all approved or declined requests to the BNR Advisory Committee.  

The Trust operates as the *technical decision arm*, while the Advisory Committee provides the *broader policy and stakeholder oversight*.

## 5. Decision Process

1. **Initial Review:** The BNR Technical Lead screens the request for completeness and risk level.  
2. **Trust Review:** The Data Trust assesses:
   - The purpose and expected benefit of the request.  
   - The data detail and potential for re-identification.  
   - The adequacy of ethics approval and data protection measures.  
3. **Decision:** The Trust may:
   - **Approve** the request with conditions.  
   - **Request clarifications** or additional safeguards.  
   - **Decline** the request if it poses high risk or lacks justification.  
4. **Recording:** Every decision is logged in the **BNR Data Release Register**.  
5. **Reporting:** A summary of approvals is submitted to the **BNR Advisory Committee** at its next meeting for formal noting and inclusion in minutes.

## 6. Relationship Between the Data Trust, Advisory Committee, and Data Sharing Agreements

| Tool or Body | Role | Description |
|---------------|------|--------------|
| **Data Sharing Agreement (DSA)** | Legal record of one data release | Signed by the BNR Technical Lead and data recipient before any restricted dataset is shared. Defines purpose, conditions, and duration. |
| **Data Trust (subset of Advisory Committee)** | Technical review and approval | Evaluates and approves data requests for compliance and public benefit. Maintains the Data Release Register. |
| **BNR Advisory Committee** | Oversight and accountability | Receives and endorses Data Trust reports, ensures policy alignment, and provides a public record of data sharing activities. |

In short: **the Data Trust makes the technical decision**, and **the Advisory Committee provides the official oversight and record**.

---

## 7. Meetings and Reporting

- The Data Trust meets **as needed**, usually quarterly or when new data requests are received.  
- Summary reports of all decisions are presented at each Advisory Committee meeting.  
- An **annual summary of data sharing activity** (number of requests, approvals, data types, and outcomes) is prepared by the BNR Technical Lead and included in the BNR Annual Report.  
- All approved projects are listed on the BNR website for transparency.

---

## 8. Handling Concerns or Breaches

If a data user fails to meet their responsibilities or a data breach occurs:

1. The user must notify the BNR Technical Lead immediately.  
2. The Technical Lead informs the Data Trust, which reviews the issue.  
3. If serious, the matter is escalated to the **BNR Advisory Committee** and, if necessary, to the **Data Protection Commissioner**.  
4. Access may be suspended or future data requests declined.

---

## 9. Review and Updates

This Data Trust Framework is reviewed **every two years** by the BNR Technical Lead and the Advisory Committee.  
Updates are approved by the Advisory Committee and endorsed by the Ministry of Health and Wellness.

---

### In Summary

The **BNR Data Trust** is a focused, technical sub-group of the **BNR Advisory Committee**.  
It ensures that:
- Data sharing decisions are made carefully and consistently,  
- Legal and ethical standards are upheld, and  
- The Advisory Committee — and by extension the public — can see how BNR data are being used for good.

By combining tight technical control with open reporting, the BNR maintains a practical, trustworthy system for sharing data safely and responsibly.
