## BNR Data Access Statement

> The Barbados National Registry for Chronic Non-Communicable Disease (BNR) is a national surveillance system operated by the George Alleyne Chronic Disease Research Centre, The University of the West Indies, on behalf of the Ministry of Health and Wellness. The BNR collects, manages, and reports data on heart attack, stroke, and cancer to inform national and regional health policy.

> BNR data are protected under national data protection and ethical governance frameworks. Access to data is managed through a structured, tiered system that balances openness with confidentiality:

> - **Public data**: Aggregated, anonymised statistics are freely available through BNR publications, reports, and public dashboards.  
- **Restricted data**: De-identified datasets may be shared with approved partners for bona fide research or public health purposes. Access requires a formal Data Sharing Agreement and, where applicable, ethical approval.  
- **Controlled data**: Identifiable or linkable data remain securely within the BNR and are not shared externally.

> All data requests are reviewed to ensure they meet legal, ethical, and scientific standards and that they align with the mission of the BNR to improve public health in Barbados and the wider Caribbean. Approved users must agree to conditions of responsible use, confidentiality, and the return or destruction of data upon project completion.
