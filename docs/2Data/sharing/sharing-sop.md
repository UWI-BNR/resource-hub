## 4. Step-by-Step Procedure

### Step 1 – Confirm Data Type and Intended Use

1. On receiving a data request, classify the request as **Public**, **Restricted**, or **Controlled** using the BNR Tiered Access model.  
2. Record the request in the **BNR Data Release Register** with date and requester details.  
3. Identify the intended use:  

      - **Research or academic**  
      - **Policy or planning**  
      - **Public communication**  
      - **Commercial or consultancy**  

4. Ensure only the **minimum necessary data** are requested to meet the purpose.

**Responsible:** BNR Technical Lead and Data Manager

### Step 2 – Review for Legal and Ethical Compliance
1. Check that the request aligns with the Barbados Data Protection Act (2019) and existing BNR policies.  
2. Confirm whether **ethics approval** is required and that it has been granted by a recognised research ethics committee.  
3. Verify that the project serves a public health or research purpose  
4. If there is any uncertainty, refer the request to the **Data Trust** for advice before proceeding.

**Responsible:** BNR Technical Lead and Data Trust

### Step 3 – Apply the Correct Governance Tool
| Type of Request | Required Governance Tool | Description |
|-----------------|--------------------------|--------------|
| **Public Data** | Internal review only | Ensure all data are aggregated and anonymised before publication or upload to Zenodo. |
| **Restricted Data** | **Data Sharing Agreement (DSA)** | Must be signed by the requester and the BNR before any data are released. Defines permitted use, data protection, and retention terms. |
| **Controlled Data** | **Internal BNR Use Only** | Access limited to authorised staff under existing confidentiality agreements. |

In all restricted cases:

- The **Data Trust** reviews and approves the request.  
- The **BNR Technical Lead** ensures the DSA is signed and stored.  
- No data are shared until both steps are complete.

**Responsible:** BNR Technical Lead and Data Trust  

---

### Step 4 – Record and Track All Approvals
1. Update the **BNR Data Release Register** for every approved request.  
   Record:  

      - Requester name and institution  
      - Dataset name and version  
      - Approval date and reviewer(s)  
      - Reference to signed DSA (if applicable)  
      - Expected end date or follow-up date  

2. Upload the signed DSA to the new record in the BNR Data Release Register.  
3. Notify the Data Manager to prepare and deliver the approved dataset.

**Responsible:** BNR Data Manager and Technical Lead  

---

### Step 5 – Communicate, Publish, and Report
1. For public data, upload anonymised datasets to the **BNR repository on Zenodo** with full metadata and a permanent DOI.  
2. Publish brief summaries of approved restricted data projects on the **BNR website**.  
3. Include annual summaries of all data releases in the **BNR Annual Report**.  
4. Present data sharing statistics and outcomes to the **BNR Advisory Committee** through the Data Trust.  
5. Encourage external data users to share project results or publications with the BNR.

**Responsible:** BNR Technical Lead, Data Manager, and Data Trust

## 5. Data Security and Confidentiality

- All datasets must be stored on secure, password-protected institutional servers.  
- Transfer of data should use encrypted, approved methods (no personal email or portable drives).  
- Access to restricted data is limited to named individuals on the DSA.  
- The BNR retains ownership of all data and may revoke access if terms are breached.  

---

## 6. Record Retention and Review

- The **BNR Data Release Register** and associated DSAs are kept permanently as the record of data governance activity.  
- The **Data Trust** reviews data sharing procedures every two years to ensure ongoing compliance with law and best practice.  
- Lessons learned from completed projects are incorporated into the next review of this SOP.
