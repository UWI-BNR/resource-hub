???- info "Data Confidentiality Note"

    The tables on this page present a range of population-level health statistics — for example, weekly counts, annual totals, incidence rates, percentages, averages, and other summary measures. These tables describe overall patterns in the population, not information about any specific person.

    All data shown here are fully anonymised:

    - no table includes personal details such as age, sex, address, or any other characteristic that could identify someone
    - the values represent combined summaries, never individual records
    - even when numbers are small, they cannot be linked back to any individual
    - no one can “reverse engineer” these summaries to work out who experienced a particular health event

    Because the information is strictly aggregate and non-identifiable, it meets the requirements of both the Barbados Data Protection Act and GDPR for the release of anonymised data. It is therefore safe and appropriate to share these statistics publicly.
