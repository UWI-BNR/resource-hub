The <strong>BNR Refit (2025–2026)</strong> is transforming how we collect and manage national data on heart disease and stroke, creating a modern, system&mdash;automated when possible&mdash;delivering insight, efficiency, and sustainability.


## Why this refit matters

For the first time, every stage—from case finding to reporting—is being redesigned for automation, traceability, and long-term sustainability. Our refit is a complete rethink of **how registry data can help to drive public health action**.  

Less manual work. More accuracy. Real-time insight.

---

## How we got here

The BNR began in 2008 with paper forms and spreadsheets. Over time, it grew into a robust electronic system using **REDCap** and **Stata**, producing national data that has helped to shape health policy and clinical care.  

Now, the refit is taking another step — connecting data entry, validation, analysis, and reporting into one continuous, code-driven workflow.

??? info "BNR Data Infrastructure – How our system evolved"

    The Barbados National Registry (BNR) started as a paper-based surveillance programme and has grown into a cloud-enabled analytics platform.  
    
    Here’s the journey in brief:

    | **Phase** | **Period & Platforms** | **Core Features** |
    |------------|----------------------|-------------------|
    | **1. Establishment & Manual Operations** | **2008 – 2015**  <br>Paper forms → TeleForm scanning → *Epi Info* databases | ➤ Launch of **BNR–Stroke (2008)** and **BNR–Heart (2009)**.  <br>➤ Data abstracted manually from hospital and death records.  <br>➤ Cleaning and QC in **Excel** and **Stata** with heavy manual effort. |
    | **2. Digitisation & REDCap Transition** | **2016 – 2024**  <br>*Epi Info* → **REDCap (GA-CDRC Server)** + **Stata Analytics** | ➤ Direct data entry via laptops/tablets.  <br>➤ Real-time validation and audit trails.  <br>➤ Secure cloud storage and daily backup.  <br>➤ Stata used for data cleaning, curation, and automated reporting. |
    | **3. Automation & Integration (Refit Phase)** | **2025 – 2026**  <br>**REDCap + Stata** unified environment | ➤ Seamless dataset release and sign-off.  <br>➤ Fully traceable analytics chain.  <br>➤ Website-based operational manuals and training.<br>➤  **Goal:** a faster, auditable, and regionally scalable data system for NCD surveillance.|

??? info "BNR–CVD Data Process – How information currently flows"

    The Cardiovascular Registry (BNR–CVD) follows a structured data pathway — from case capture to final report.  
    Each phase is being streamlined to cut lag times and improve quality.

    ### 1. Case Capture and Preparation *(Pre-REDCap)*
    - Identify stroke and heart-attack cases from hospitals and death records.  
    - Confirm eligibility using WHO/ICD-10 definitions and residency rules.  
    - Record all suspected cases on a **Notifications** list before abstraction.  
    - Collect data Directly into a REDCap database using using remote data entry.

    **Outcome:** a verified, standardised set of cases.

    ---

    ### 2. Data Entry and Quality Control *(Within REDCap)*
    - Enter data directly into REDCap instruments with built-in validation and audit trails.  
    - Logic and range checks help with accuracy.  
    - Re-abstraction by a QC coordinator maintains consistency.  
    - Roles include abstractors, QC lead, analyst, and registry technical lead.

    **Outcome:** Registry data stored securely in a REDCap database, with data mimicking availability from hospital sources.

    ---

    ### 3. Analysis and Reporting *(Post-REDCap)*
    - Export datasets to **Stata** for curation, linkage, and analytics.  
    - Generate indicators for incidence, mortality, and performance (e.g., reperfusion, CT use).  
    - Produce flagship annual report shared with the Ministry of Health and Wellness, advisory boards, and clinicians. 
    - Otherwise, Registry reach could be improved. 

    **Impact:** BNR data have directly informed the creation of Barbados’ **Stroke Unit**, **thrombolytic protocols**, and improvements in **acute cardiac care**.

## What’s next

This refit goes beyond a technical refresh — it’s an investment in the registry’s future. Our upgrades take advantage of recent advances in data science, and adapt to new Data Protection Regulations across the Caribbean. 

By helping our team adjust to new digital opportunities, the BNR is becoming a **model of regional excellence** in health data automation.
