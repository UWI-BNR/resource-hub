# Analytic Improvements

!!! info "Check this page for weekly updates on refit progress"

This section details the analytic improvements planned for *Stage 1 of the BNR Refit*, where legacy Stata code is being restructured into modular workflows. The goal is to make analysis faster, more transparent, and reproducible — laying the groundwork for full automation in later stages. These changes bridge immediate operational needs with longer-term goals for an integrated, digital reporting system.  

### How Will We Help

The *“How Will We Help”* column indicates the level of engagement for each activity under *Stage 1 of the BNR Refit*. While the refit’s initial scope focused on post-REDCap processes, the audit highlighted wider opportunities for improvement that will continue across later stages of implementation.

| **Icon** | **Meaning** | **Interpretation within the Refit Programme** |
|-----------|--------------|----------------------------------------------|
| 🗹 **Lead** | Tasks delivered directly within this consultancy’s scope. | Core actions already funded and underway as part of Stage 1. These lay the technical foundation for later phases. |
| ⚙ **Contribute** | Tasks that extend beyond the formal project scope but are closely connected to Stage 1 goals. | The team provides targeted technical input or coordination support to help maintain alignment across the wider refit. |
| ⓘ **Advise** | Tasks primarily owned by partners or future workstreams. | The team offers strategic guidance and documentation to support smooth handover into subsequent stages of the refit. |

Together, these process improvements form the operational base on which the refit’s later automation and governance systems will be built.
