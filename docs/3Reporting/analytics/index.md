# Reporting Outputs

## **Reporting Refit**
We will create a series of BNR briefings, that:

- Can be easily recreated as new data are available
- Are short - quickly read by clinicians, decicion-makers, researchers.
- Are modular, and can be added together into a more formal occassional (e.g. annual) report.
  
## **Planned Briefings**
We will develop the new briefings in stages:

- **Stage 1:** Core briefings for which data are prepared and quality-controlled
- **Stage 2:** Additional briefings for which data need additional quality-control
- **Suggested:** We also list additional *"added-value"* briefings for future approval and creation  
  

| **Briefing Title / Focus** | **Why This is Important** | **Metrics Included** | ✅ **Done** |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------|-------------|
| **STAGE 1 BRIEFINGS**| | | |
| **Weekly Hospital Counts — 2023 vs 5-Year Average** | Tracking weekly counts shows whether hospital admissions are following past seasonal trends or shifting over time. It’s the simplest early signal of changing disease patterns and health service demand. | • Weekly stroke and heart attack counts (2023 vs 2018–22 avg)<br>• Proportion aged <70 vs ≥70<br>• Sex distribution | ✅ |
| **Hospital-Based Event Rates — 2023 vs 5-Year Average** | Moving from counts to *rates* accounts for population change, allowing fair year-to-year comparison. Standardised rates help identify true increases in risk rather than population growth. Comment on population growth + aging. | • Hospital cases ÷ Barbados population × 100,000<br>• Age- and sex-specific rates<br>• Age-standardised rate (WHO world standard)<br>• Stroke vs AMI comparison | ✅ |
| **In-Hospital Deaths — What They Tell Us** | In-hospital fatality reflects both disease severity and quality of emergency and inpatient care. Monitoring trends helps identify whether outcomes are improving and where early deaths might be prevented. | • Number and % deaths among admitted cases<br>• Age- and sex-specific in-hospital CFRs<br>• Stroke vs AMI comparison<br>• Trend 2010–2023 | ✅ |
| **Hospital Length of Stay — How Long Are Patients Admitted?** | Length of stay captures both clinical recovery and hospital efficiency. Shorter stays may suggest improved management or early discharge; longer stays may indicate complications or bed-flow issues. | • Median (range) length of stay, total & ward<br>• By age, sex, event type<br>• Trend over time | ✅ |
| **STAGE 2 BRIEFINGS**| | | |
| **Quality of Acute MI Care — The STEMI Story** | Quality indicators reveal how quickly and effectively hospitals treat life-threatening heart attacks. Measuring these benchmarks builds accountability and demonstrates progress in emergency response. | • Aspirin within 24 hrs<br>• % receiving reperfusion<br>• Median door-to-needle time<br>• Median onset-to-fibrinolysis time<br>• % receiving echocardiogram before discharge<br>• % prescribed aspirin or statin at discharge | ☐ |
| **Quality of Acute Stroke Care — Use of the Stroke Unit** | Dedicated stroke unit care is proven to reduce death and disability. Monitoring how often eligible patients receive specialist care shows how well the system is translating evidence into practice. | • % of admitted stroke patients managed in stroke unit<br>• % receiving CT scan at presentation<br>• % receiving reperfusion (TPA)<br>• % prescribed anti-thrombotics / statins at discharge | ☐ |
| **National mortality trends in Barbados – what death registration data reveal about changing causes of death** | The national death registry provides the most complete record of population-level mortality. Analysing cause-specific mortality trends offers context for BNR findings, showing how CVD, cancer, diabetes, and other NCDs contribute to total deaths and premature mortality over time. This briefing would benchmark Barbados against regional and global mortality patterns. | All-cause and cause-specific mortality rates (CVD, cancer, diabetes, external causes); age-standardised mortality rates; premature mortality (30–69 years); comparison with WHO Mortality Database, PAHO Core Indicators, and CARICOM datasets. | ☐ |
| **BNR survival rates after record linkage with national death registry data** | Linking BNR event data to national death records allows tracking of long-term outcomes beyond hospital discharge. Survival analysis (1-year, 3-year, 5-year) can identify inequalities by age, sex, and diagnosis, and measure improvements in care over time. This briefing strengthens the registry’s role in outcome monitoring. | Linkage of BNR event data with national death records; 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates by disease, sex, and age group; Kaplan–Meier curves; comparison of survival trends across registry years. | ☐ |
| ***ADDED-VALUE* BRIEFINGS**| | | |
| **Understanding Missing Data — and Why It Matters** | Data completeness is the foundation for credible public health decisions. Assessing missingness identifies weak points in documentation, abstraction, or access. | • Proportion of records with missing values by variable (e.g., risk factors, vital status, treatment)<br>• Comparison by year and registry<br>• Qualitative causes (e.g., note loss, COVID access limits)<br>• Plans for improvement (REDCap, QC workflow) | ☐ |
| **Beyond the Numbers — Connecting Registry Insights to the Bigger Picture** | Registry findings gain meaning when viewed against wider trends. Linking to regional and global data helps interpret whether local patterns are unique or part of shared Caribbean challenges. | • Trends vs regional/WHO data on CVD mortality and risk factors<br>• Context: PAHO HEARTS initiative, national hypertension control<br>• High-level summary of progress and next steps for prevention & care | ☐ |
| **Demographic change in Barbados – implications for NCD burden and health system demand** | Barbados’s population is ageing rapidly, fertility is declining, and migration continues to shape its working-age structure. These shifts alter the balance of disease burden and the demand for health and social care. Understanding demographic change helps explain rising chronic disease rates and guides planning for prevention, long-term care, and workforce needs. | Population size and age structure (BSS, UN WPP); dependency ratio; median age; fertility and migration trends; proportion aged 65+; projected population to 2050; comparison with BNR incidence and mortality trends. | ☐ |
