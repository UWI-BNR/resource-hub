# Operations Manual Overview

The *BNR Operations Manual* will serve as the central reference for how the registry functions day to day — documenting procedures, responsibilities, and workflows across all areas of operation. This is *not part of Stage 1 of the BNR Refit*, but will be developed progressively as systems are stabilised and resources permit.

This manual will draw directly from *Recommendation 14 (Sustainability and Governance Enhancements)* and *Recommendation 8 (Open Standards and Documentation)* of the *BNR Process Audit*, as well as related deliverables on dataset governance, data release, and reporting. Over time, it will expand to include standard operating procedures, staff responsibilities, version-control practices, and risk management processes.

Each page added will strengthen institutional memory and support future audit, training, and accreditation needs — ensuring that the BNR remains transparent, consistent, and resilient as it evolves.
