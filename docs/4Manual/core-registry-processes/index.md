# Core Registry Processes Overview

!!! note "Living document"
    This section summarises the **core operational processes** that underpin all BNR registry components.

On this page:

- The common process model across BNR–Stroke, BNR–Heart, and BNR–Cancer
- The relationship between **case identification**, **abstraction**, **data cleaning**, and **dataset release**
- Links to detailed process pages in this section

_This overview should stay fairly stable; detailed rules live on the sub-pages._
