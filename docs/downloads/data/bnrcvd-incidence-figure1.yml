description: Annual age-standardized incidence (2010-2023), for hospital events and DCO events. We looked at all heart attack and stroke events that were treated in hospital or recorded as the main cause of death. Using Barbados population estimates, we calculated how many people per 100,000 experienced these conditions each year. We then adjusted rates for age so that figures from different years, or between men and women, could be compared on equal terms. These analyses give a clear, evidence-based picture of how cardiovascular disease is affecting Barbadians over time.
