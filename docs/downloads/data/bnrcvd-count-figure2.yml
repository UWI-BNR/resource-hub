description: CVD cases by broad age group (<70., 70+ yrs) in 2023, compared to 5-year average. We reviewed all hospital-registered strokes and heart attacks for 2023 and compared them with the previous five years. We examined who was affected—men and women under 70 and those 70 and older—and tracked how cases built up week by week. By comparing 2023 counts with the five-year average, we could see when numbers rose above or fell below what would normally be expected.
