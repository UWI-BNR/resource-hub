Case Identification - Active: routine ward visits to QEH (A&amp;E, medical wards, radiology, rehabilitation, death records) and major polyclinics.- Passive: notifications from hospitals, physicians, and clinics.- Death-Certificate-Only (DCO): national death register checked for ICD-10 CVD codes.- Private sector: engagement with private hospitals and emergency clinics. Eligibility Confirmation - Definitions: WHO/ICD-10 for AMI; WHO STEPS for stroke.- Residency: \u22656 months in Barbados in previous 12 months.- Scope: all ages; recurrent events retained; First-Ever Stroke (FES) flagged.- De-duplication: resolved before abstraction. Abstraction Preparation - Use standard, version-controlled Case Reporting Forms (CRFs).- Pre-check for completeness, coherence, and ICD coding.- Flag missing data, ambiguous eligibility, or irretrievable notes for review.- All suspected events logged on a Notifications list with status (eligible/ineligible/pending).

It builds on more than a decade of registry experience and turns what was once a heavily manual process into one that is cleaner, faster, and so hopefully easier to maintain. I</p> <p>Importantly, we hope to automate out manual data correction errors, and speed up the time between abstraction and report delivery.</p> <p>The work is divided into five phases, each one laying the foundation for the next and connecting directly to the process, data, automation, analytics, reporting, and KPI changes that follow.</p> <p>Phase 0 \u2013 Building the foundation: We began by cleaning and combining all existing CVD datasets to create one complete cumulative record from the registry\u2019s first year through to 2023. This work produced a single \u201csource of truth\u201d dataset and the first set of reusable Stata scripts, forming the base for later automation.</p> <p>Phase 1 \u2013 Understanding our system: Next, focussing on the post-REDCap phase, we examined active pre-Refit Stata algorithms. This audit told us what was working, what wasn\u2019t, and how we could standardise the process of signing off monthly datasets. The result was a clearer map of the current system and a new standard operating procedure for dataset release.</p> <p>Phase 2 \u2013 Automating our analytics: After these first foundational phases, we moved on to redesigning how the data are analysed. We created Stata programs that can run monthly and perform analyses with some level of automation. The automation removed the previous reliance on new algorithms for each analysis (primarily for bespoke data cleaning), hopefully improving the consistency and timliness of results.</p> <p>Phase 3 \u2013 Making the system accessible: To make sure staff can use the new tools without advanced coding skills, we built a set of easy-to-install BNR Stata commands. These provide \u201clow-code\u201d access to the automated analytics and reports, making the system more inclusive and sustainable over time.</p> <p>Phase 4 \u2013 Sharing knowledge: Finally, we developed training to help BNR staff use and maintain the new system confidently. This is provided by an online self-paced learning site, ensuring that the knowledge behind the system is shared and embedded for the future.</p> <p>Together, these phases mark a shift from a person-dependent system to a process-driven one\u2014where clean data, clear documentation, and simple automation keep the registry stronger for the longer term.  </p> <p>\u27a1\ufe0f Explore the next sections to see how each area of change unfolds: Process Changes \u25cb Data Changes \u25cb Analytics Changes \u25cb Reporting Changes.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"01_Workflow/updates/analytics-new/","title":"Analytic Changes","text":"<p>Notes: </p> <ol> <li>These analytic changes modernise how the BNR turns clean data into meaningful results, moving from manual reporting to a semi-automated, standardised system.  </li> <li>Together, they reduce analysis time, improve reproducibility, and ensure consistency across monthly, annual, and administrative outputs.</li> </ol> <p>Key:  \u274c Not started \ud83d\udfe8 Underway \u2705 Completed</p> CHANGE MADE RATIONALE HOW WILL WE HELP RESOURCE New Analytics Plan \u27a4 To create a clear statistical analysis plan using the BNR data, covering annual, monthly, and ad-hoc reporting. \ud83d\uddf9 Lead \ud83d\udfe8See statistical analysis plan New Stata code for analytics behind annual report \u27a4 To rebuild the annual analytic pipeline in Stata using standardised datasets and reusable code blocks. \ud83d\uddf9 Lead \u274cSee Stata algorithms (Annual ADO)Incidence) \u27a4 Incidence metrics. \ud83d\uddf9 Lead \u274c (Annual ADO)Mortality) \u27a4 Mortality metrics. \ud83d\uddf9 Lead \u274c (Annual ADO)KPIs) \u27a4 Health system performance KPIs. \ud83d\uddf9 Lead \u274c New Stata code for analytics behind monthly report \u27a4 To automate the generation of monthly registry summaries to support rapid monitoring of case trends and data completeness.\u27a4 Allows near real-time feedback to staff and stakeholders. \ud83d\uddf9 Lead \u274cSee Stata algorithms (Monthly ADO)Numbers) \u27a4 Monthly cases. \ud83d\uddf9 Lead \u274c (Monthly ADO)Rates) \u27a4 Smoothed rolling rates. \ud83d\uddf9 Lead \u274c (Monthly ADO)KPI 1) \u27a4 Abstraction rate. \ud83d\uddf9 Lead \u274c (Monthly ADO)KPI 2) \u27a4 Locked case rate. \ud83d\uddf9 Lead \u274c (Monthly ADO)KPI 3) \u27a4 Caterpiller chart: cumulative cases vs. previous years. \ud83d\uddf9 Lead \u274c (Monthly ADO)Data Check) \u27a4 Major data flaws.

Here are some of the important data issues, and how we might sort through them, to deliver something useful for the project:</p> Issue Description Consequence The 2023 Database revamp \u27a4 Poorly executed. \u27a4 System left in development throughout - changes therefore not audited by our system \u27a4 We know of some consequences. Perhaps not all... \u27a4 Certain key variables underwent change of meaning. We will create a mapping of key variables. There is no definitive historical CVD dataset (that we can find) \u27a4 The BNR historical record has never been organised, and seems in disarray. \u27a4 Process documentation and dataset documentation, if they exist, are lost in the unorganised folder structures. \u27a4 We have 'patched together' our best guess of the historical data record.\u27a4 To some extent, we are doing the same for process, but this goes beyond the Refit scope. Potentially unfixable missingness \u27a4 Unique IDs for a batch of the historical data record (20xx to 20xx) are missing \u27a4 We have created new IDs. \u27a4 But this affects (e.g.) repeat strokes. Within-REDCap data cleaning process seems minimal, or at best incomplete. \u27a4 within-REDCap data cleaning has - at least in part - broken down. \u27a4 Or perhaps within-REDCap data processing was never fully initiated by the BNR leads? \u27a4 This problem - over the years - has been patched by mixing post-REDCap data cleaning with analytics.\u27a4 This has created \"hard to manage\" analytical code that needs substantial alteration for each analysis run. \u27a4 Code recycling (without implementing those important alterations) has likely led to analysis errors. The planned Refit automation will rely on dataset invariance \u27a4 In this work, we had planned to append new cases to the cumulative data record each month.\u27a4 Each new monthly addition must have the same structure as the cumulative record. \u27a4 Currently, data messyness within REDCap will be problematic.\u27a4 We are correcting the cumulative record to Dec 2023. Thereafter, without within-REDCap process improvements, errors will likely re-appear Death data not currently fit for purpose \u27a4 Problem exists because underlying CoD (UCOD) not provided by MoHW.\u27a4 The current BNR solution is flawed in several ways: \u27a4\u27a4 (a) BNR opts for post-REDCap data cleaning. This mixes data prep + analytics. \u27a4 Proposed analytics automation becomes difficult. Each monthly export requires updated data cleaning <code>.do</code> files. More automation = more points of failure. \u27a4\u27a4 (b) The current BNR approach (possibly) uses all listed causes, not UCOD. Overestimatation?? \u27a4 Simply. We don't know... Sensitivity work required. \u27a4\u27a4 (c) The current BNR approach ignores the 'proximal / causal' importance of free text. It simply finds keywords. So terms like due to, secondary to, as a result of and so on, are probably ignored. These are key for UCOD coding. \u27a4 Again - implications unclear at this point. <p>That's a few of the rather sobering findings from the project audit so far. The important question now, is what can we do, as part of this funded work, to make this work. We can do a lot I think. Here are some ideas, for discussion...</p> Idea Description As part of this Refit, we could develop a longer-term 'Staged Improvement Plan' \u27a4 We create an uber Refit plan, with several major steps. \u27a4 This consultancy would likely be Stage 1. Further stages will be needed, but I imagine will need Advisory Committee involvement? Initially (Stage 1?), reduce level of planned automation \u27a4 We can improve project analytics a lot without full automation. A full set of analysis only <code>.do</code> files will be a huge improvement, without accompanying <code>.ado</code> files, menuing, or dialogue boxes. \u27a4 More automation at this point = more points of failure.\u27a4 Careful use of <code>do</code> files by approved personnel should be fine. Create new monthly outputs for continuous reporting \u27a4 With monthly data exports - I'll assume these will be possible without (or with minimal) errors at this point - we could create a new series of continuous output results from the BNR - simple counts, smoothed incidence trends, charts compared to previous years. Dashboard?  \u27a4 Added benefit of early error flags Use monthly outputs to monitor performance KPIs \u27a4 These monthly reports could also be used to monitor BNR performance metrics. Reduce number of REDCap database variables further \u27a4 The exported dataset still contains close to 150 variables. Are they all needed? Could we still operate on a further reduced dataset, allied to simpler processing?\u27a4 Not sure myself, but worth a discussion? Usefulness might be compromised a little, but quality right now is struggling, right? Create a new category of research analytics \u27a4 For example, for survival analysis, we might decide to shift the linkage of death records and incident cases to an 'occasional' research analysis - to remove the need for this time-consuming data preparation step. Simplify process wherever possible \u27a4 Linked to the 'Staged Improvement Plan'. Worth a discussion to think through how we might do this? 'Staged Improvement Plan' = opportunity for radical revamp. \u27a4 My personal favourite :)\u27a4 E.g. a new BNR might include:\u27a4\u27a4 Hospital-based AMI and CVD registry\u27a4\u27a4 Official UCOD reporting - Barbados currently judged as poor by WHO.\u27a4\u27a4 HEARTS monitoring\u27a4\u27a4 Other monitoring of outcomes available via electronic record <p></p>"},{"location":"02_Data/dataset-dissemination/","title":"BNR Dataset Dissemination SOP","text":"<p>Document Type: Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Document Version: v1.0 Effective Date: [Insert Date] Author: BNR Data Governance Committee Approved by: BNR Professional Advisory Board  </p>"},{"location":"02_Data/dataset-dissemination/#1-purpose","title":"1.
