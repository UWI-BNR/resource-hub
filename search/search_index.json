While all deaths are medically certified, the underlying cause of death (UCOD)\u2014formally coded using internationally-accepted rules\u2014is not provided by the Barbados Government. The current registry workaround\u2014keyword searches of free text\u2014does not achieve the precision or reproducibility required for national or WHO reporting. The absence of coded UCOD data limits the accuracy of mortality statistics and complicates linkage between deaths and prior events. \ud83d\udd34 Inconsistent inclusion criteria Definitions of \u201celigible\u201d and \u201cineligible\u201d cases have varied over time, and trace-back periods before dataset closure have been inconsistently applied. These inconsistencies affect the comparability of trends and can distort incidence estimates. \ud83d\udfe0 Weak duplication controls at abstraction Current case-finding procedures do not consistently include a step to check for existing records before creating new entries. Duplicated records can inflate event counts and compromise trend accuracy. \ud83d\udfe2 Loss of historical identifiers (2009\u20132017) Certain analysis files have lost key identifiers over time due to the blending of data cleaning and analytical processes and limited control of Stata algorithms. While most (potentially not all) identifiers remain in the source data, their removal from intermediate files has complicated longitudinal linkage and required retrospective reconstruction to restore completeness. Missing identifiers reduce the ability to assess repeat events and survival.It remains possible that datasets without full age information have been used in past annual reports. <p>Most Urgent Actions (Recommendations 3\u20135 - See Below)</p> <ul> <li>Re-establish a hospital-based registry model to ensure consistent, verifiable case capture of incident cases.  </li> <li>Introduce and lead on national UCOD assignment using World Health Organization IRIS software.  </li> <li>Standardise eligibility definitions and strengthen duplicate checking as a key part of the abstraction process.</li> <li>Build and document a single cumulative data record (2009-2023)</li> </ul> <p>Summary: The pre-REDCap phase presents several foundational data-quality risks that directly affect national comparability. Addressing these will require structural adjustments rather than additional resources. The registry can move quickly toward improvement through a quality-managed hospital-based verification process, standardised inclusion rules, and adoption of IRIS for formal UCOD coding\u2014changes that will align BNR methods with international best practice.</p>"},{"location":"1Workflow/bnr-process-audit/findings/#b-data-entry-and-quality-control-within-redcap","title":"(b) Data Entry and Quality Control (Within-REDCap)","text":"Priority / Issue What\u2019s Happening Why It Matters \ud83d\udd34 2023 database rebuild left incomplete The database remained in \u201cdevelopment\u201d mode during live use, allowing field edits and changes without formal version control. This has caused variation in variable meaning and reduced the reliability of year-on-year comparison. \ud83d\udd34 Limited in-system data validation Required-field and logic checks were removed for several variables during updates. The absence of automated validation increases risk of missing or inconsistent values. \ud83d\udfe0 Minimal documentation of variable definitions There is no unified data dictionary, and field meanings have diverged over time. Analysts cannot always verify which variable versions are current, making automation and reproducibility difficult. \ud83d\udfe0 Incomplete REDCap-level data cleaning Within-REDCap cleaning and verification have not yet been consistently implemented.

Measuring these benchmarks builds accountability and demonstrates progress in emergency response. \u2022 Aspirin within 24 hrs\u2022 % receiving reperfusion\u2022 Median door-to-needle time\u2022 Median onset-to-fibrinolysis time\u2022 % receiving echocardiogram before discharge\u2022 % prescribed aspirin or statin at discharge \u2610 Quality of Acute Stroke Care \u2014 Use of the Stroke Unit Dedicated stroke unit care is proven to reduce death and disability. Monitoring how often eligible patients receive specialist care shows how well the system is translating evidence into practice. \u2022 % of admitted stroke patients managed in stroke unit\u2022 % receiving CT scan at presentation\u2022 % receiving reperfusion (TPA)\u2022 % prescribed anti-thrombotics / statins at discharge \u2610 National mortality trends in Barbados \u2013 what death registration data reveal about changing causes of death The national death registry provides the most complete record of population-level mortality. Analysing cause-specific mortality trends offers context for BNR findings, showing how CVD, cancer, diabetes, and other NCDs contribute to total deaths and premature mortality over time. This briefing would benchmark Barbados against regional and global mortality patterns. All-cause and cause-specific mortality rates (CVD, cancer, diabetes, external causes); age-standardised mortality rates; premature mortality (30\u201369 years); comparison with WHO Mortality Database, PAHO Core Indicators, and CARICOM datasets. \u2610 BNR survival rates after record linkage with national death registry data Linking BNR event data to national death records allows tracking of long-term outcomes beyond hospital discharge. Survival analysis (1-year, 3-year, 5-year) can identify inequalities by age, sex, and diagnosis, and measure improvements in care over time. This briefing strengthens the registry\u2019s role in outcome monitoring. Linkage of BNR event data with national death records; 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates by disease, sex, and age group; Kaplan\u2013Meier curves; comparison of survival trends across registry years. \u2610 ADDED-VALUE BRIEFINGS Understanding Missing Data \u2014 and Why It Matters Data completeness is the foundation for credible public health decisions. Assessing missingness identifies weak points in documentation, abstraction, or access. \u2022 Proportion of records with missing values by variable (e.g., risk factors, vital status, treatment)\u2022 Comparison by year and registry\u2022 Qualitative causes (e.g., note loss, COVID access limits)\u2022 Plans for improvement (REDCap, QC workflow) \u2610 Beyond the Numbers \u2014 Connecting Registry Insights to the Bigger Picture Registry findings gain meaning when viewed against wider trends. Linking to regional and global data helps interpret whether local patterns are unique or part of shared Caribbean challenges. \u2022 Trends vs regional/WHO data on CVD mortality and risk factors\u2022 Context: PAHO HEARTS initiative, national hypertension control\u2022 High-level summary of progress and next steps for prevention &amp; care \u2610 Demographic change in Barbados \u2013 implications for NCD burden and health system demand Barbados\u2019s population is ageing rapidly, fertility is declining, and migration continues to shape its working-age structure. These shifts alter the balance of disease burden and the demand for health and social care. Understanding demographic change helps explain rising chronic disease rates and guides planning for prevention, long-term care, and workforce needs.
