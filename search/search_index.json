While all deaths are medically certified, the underlying cause of death (UCOD)\u2014formally coded using internationally-accepted rules\u2014is not provided by the Barbados Government. The current registry workaround\u2014keyword searches of free text\u2014does not achieve the precision or reproducibility required for national or WHO reporting. The absence of coded UCOD data limits the accuracy of mortality statistics and complicates linkage between deaths and prior events. \ud83d\udd34 Inconsistent inclusion criteria Definitions of \u201celigible\u201d and \u201cineligible\u201d cases have varied over time, and trace-back periods before dataset closure have been inconsistently applied. These inconsistencies affect the comparability of trends and can distort incidence estimates. \ud83d\udfe0 Weak duplication controls at abstraction Current case-finding procedures do not consistently include a step to check for existing records before creating new entries. Duplicated records can inflate event counts and compromise trend accuracy. \ud83d\udfe2 Loss of historical identifiers (2009\u20132017) Certain analysis files have lost key identifiers over time due to the blending of data cleaning and analytical processes and limited control of Stata algorithms. While most (potentially not all) identifiers remain in the source data, their removal from intermediate files has complicated longitudinal linkage and required retrospective reconstruction to restore completeness. Missing identifiers reduce the ability to assess repeat events and survival.It remains possible that datasets without full age information have been used in past annual reports. <p>Most Urgent Actions (Recommendations 3\u20135 - See Below)</p> <ul> <li>Re-establish a hospital-based registry model to ensure consistent, verifiable case capture of incident cases.  </li> <li>Introduce and lead on national UCOD assignment using World Health Organization IRIS software.  </li> <li>Standardise eligibility definitions and strengthen duplicate checking as a key part of the abstraction process.</li> <li>Build and document a single cumulative data record (2009-2023)</li> </ul> <p>Summary: The pre-REDCap phase presents several foundational data-quality risks that directly affect national comparability. Addressing these will require structural adjustments rather than additional resources. The registry can move quickly toward improvement through a quality-managed hospital-based verification process, standardised inclusion rules, and adoption of IRIS for formal UCOD coding\u2014changes that will align BNR methods with international best practice.</p>"},{"location":"1Workflow/bnr-process-audit/findings/#b-data-entry-and-quality-control-within-redcap","title":"(b) Data Entry and Quality Control (Within-REDCap)","text":"Priority / Issue What\u2019s Happening Why It Matters \ud83d\udd34 2023 database rebuild left incomplete The database remained in \u201cdevelopment\u201d mode during live use, allowing field edits and changes without formal version control. This has caused variation in variable meaning and reduced the reliability of year-on-year comparison. \ud83d\udd34 Limited in-system data validation Required-field and logic checks were removed for several variables during updates. The absence of automated validation increases risk of missing or inconsistent values. \ud83d\udfe0 Minimal documentation of variable definitions There is no unified data dictionary, and field meanings have diverged over time. Analysts cannot always verify which variable versions are current, making automation and reproducibility difficult. \ud83d\udfe0 Incomplete REDCap-level data cleaning Within-REDCap cleaning and verification have not yet been consistently implemented.
