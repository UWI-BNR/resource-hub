description: Median length of hospital stay. Cardiovascular admissions place substantial pressure on the health system, not only through the number of events but through the time patients spend in hospital. Length of hospital stay (LOS) reflects severity, access to step-down care, and ward efficiency—all key considerations for service planning. We analysed median LOS (with 25th–75th percentiles) for all stroke and heart attack (acute myocardial infarction, AMI) admissions between 2010 and 2023, using routinely collected hospital data held by the BNR. We summarised trends over time and applied quantile (median) regression, which estimates how the median LOS shifts across groups, to explore differences by event type, sex, and two-year periods.
