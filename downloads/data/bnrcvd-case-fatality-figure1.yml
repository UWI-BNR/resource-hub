description: In-hospital deaths (2010-2023) by event type, sex, 2-year time intervals. We analysed hospital admissions for stroke and heart attack in Barbados from 2010 to 2023. For each two-year period, we calculated the proportion of patients who died before discharge — the in-hospital case-fatality rate — by sex. To account for incomplete follow-up in recent years, we showed both confirmed hospital deaths (solid lines) and confirmed + probable deaths (dotted lines), where “probable” refers to patients who died within seven days of their event but whose discharge date has not yet been verified. The figure shows these actual rates; we used separate modelling to estimate uncertainty and adjust for age.
