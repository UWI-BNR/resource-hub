description: Extra typical bed-day demand. Hospital planners need to understand not only how long patients typically stay, but how those stays add up across all admissions to create pressure on bed capacity. A small increase in the typical length of stay can translate into a large number of additional beds needed when multiplied across hundreds of patients. To capture this system-level impact, we created an “extra typical bed-days” metric. This measures how many more bed-days are required today compared with a decade ago, based on changes in the median length of stay and the number of stroke and heart attack admissions. Using routinely collected BNR between 2014 and 2023, we calculated the difference in median length of stay between each year and a 2014 baseline, and multiplied this by the number of events in each year. This approach avoids distortion from rare but very long hospital stays so provides a robust indicator of how routine changes in typical patient care accumulate into real bed pressure over time.
